# Sixty-Two
Self-contained python script that converts old Minecraft skin formats (64x32) to modern format (64x64).

# Usage
- Download the repository, extract as a folder.
- Use the "input" folder to insert your old format skins.
- Run **main.py**.
- The converted skins will be available in the "output" folder.

# Skins
Two skins were downloaded from [Novaskin](https://minecraft.novaskin.me/) as to demonstrate the capabilities of that script.

# QNA
> Who is this script for?

Archivists, retro projects or video content creators who are looking to convert old skins to new format.
> Many skins are already 64x64!

For the minority of people who likes to work on a 64x32 canvas in softwares like paint, this tool could be helpful.

# Support
Open an issue if needed, but I doubt you'll be running into many issues with this.
